            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-foreground">Return Policy</h2>

            <p>
              You may return most new, unopened items within 30 days of delivery for a full refund. We'll also pay the
              return shipping costs if the return is a result of our error (you received an incorrect or defective item,
              etc.).
            </p>

            <p>
              You should expect to receive your refund within 2-3 weeks of giving your package to the return shipper;
              however, in many cases you will receive a refund more quickly. This time period includes the transit time
              for us to receive your return from the shipper (5 to 10 business days), the time it takes us to process
              your return once we receive it (3 to 5 business days), and the time it takes your bank to process our
              refund request (5 to 10 business days).
            </p>
